This getcpu override example shows how to implement and load a getcpu
override plugin for LTTng-UST. This can be useful in cases where direct
hardware access is available for architecture-specific registers holding
the CPU number, and where it should be used rather than the Linux kernel
sched_getcpu() vDSO/syscall.
